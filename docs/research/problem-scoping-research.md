## Problem Definition & Business Impact

### Current State Analysis

The traditional approach to employee grievance management is characterized by manual, paper-based processes that create operational inefficiencies and employee dissatisfaction. The CIPD Good Work Index 2024 reveals that a quarter (25%) of UK employees—an estimated eight million people—encountered workplace conflict in the past year.

Research conducted with YouGov for the 2024 CIPD Good Work Index, surveying 5,496 workers, shows that **only around a third of employees feel the conflict they experienced at work has been fully resolved**. This indicates a significant gap in current grievance resolution effectiveness.

### Scale and Impact of the Problem

#### Financial Impact
U.S. employees spend **2.8 hours per week** involved with conflict, which amounts to approximately **$359 billion in paid hours** (based on average hourly earnings), according to CPP Global research. This represents a massive drain on organizational productivity and resources.

#### Organizational Impact
The most common forms of workplace conflict reported were:
- Being humiliated or undermined at work (**48%**)
- Being shouted at or having a heated argument (**35%**)
- Verbal abuse or insults (**34%**)
- Discriminatory behavior (**20%**)

Among employees experiencing conflict:
- **42%** said they felt exhausted all or most of the time, compared with **18%** of those who reported no conflict
- **37%** said they felt under pressure all or most of the time, compared with **15%** of those who didn't experience any conflict

#### Operational Challenges
- Manual case processing creates bottlenecks
- Lack of standardized documentation
- Inconsistent response times
- Poor visibility into case status
- Limited ability to identify systemic patterns
